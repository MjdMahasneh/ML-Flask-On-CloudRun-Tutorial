## Step 1: Prepare Your Model
### Requirements
The project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Here's a quick overview:

```shell
torch>=1.12.0
torchvision>=0.13.0  # Optional, if needed for image processing
scikit-learn>=1.1.1
Flask
```


#### Create a PyTorch Model by running iris_cls_train.py
```shell
python iris_cls_train.py
```






## Step 2: Create a Google Cloud Account
- Go to the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) website and sign up for an account.
- Set up a billing account (note that Google offers a free trial with $300 credit).
Enable the Required Services
You'll need to enable several services on GCP, including Google Cloud Build and Cloud Run, which are essential for building and deploying your application.

#### Open the Google [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" on the left-hand menu.
- Enable APIs and Services by searching for and enabling the following:
  - Cloud Run API
  - Cloud Build API
  - Container Registry API



## Step 3: Download the Google Cloud SDK
#### Download the Google Cloud SDK
Go to the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) webpage: Visit Google Cloud SDK to find the latest version of the SDK.
- Choose the correct version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Download the installer or the archive as appropriate for your system.
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### Initialize the Google Cloud SDK
- Open your command line or terminal.
- Run the initialization command:
```shell
gcloud init
```
- Log in to your Google account when prompted by the SDK. This will open a new browser window asking you to choose a Google account and grant the Google Cloud SDK permission to access your Google Cloud resources.
- Select a Cloud Project: After logging in, the SDK will ask you to select a project from your GCP account or create a new one.

#### Verify Installation
After initializing, verify that the installation and setup were successful by running:
```shell
gcloud info
```

This command displays information about your current environment, including the active account and project.

#### List the Projects:
Run the following command to see all the projects associated with your current Google Cloud account:
    ```shell
    gcloud projects list
    ```
#### Set This Project as Your Default:
To simplify future commands, set this as your default project in your Google Cloud SDK settings. Run the following command in your Command Prompt:

```shell
  gcloud config set project buoyant-program-442017-k3
```
This command will configure your Google Cloud SDK to automatically use this project for all operations, eliminating the need to specify the project ID in future commands.

#### Set Compute Zone:
Choose a default compute zone, which is the region where your resources will be located by default. For example, us-central1-a, for USA, or europe-west2-a, for Europe. Run the following command to set the default compute zone:

```shell
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west2-a
```

 Now your Google Cloud environment is ready to deploy applications, create resources, and make the most out of the Google Cloud services available to you.



## Step 5: Install Necessary Tools and Set Up Your Environment
#### Install Docker:
You'll need Docker to create containers for your model. You can download and install Docker from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) official site.

Docker Desktop is the tool you'll need to create, manage, and run Docker containers on your Windows system. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easier to manage containers and Docker resources.

- Download Docker Desktop for Windows:
Visit the Docker Hub and download the Docker Desktop installer for Windows.

- Install Docker Desktop:
Run the installer you downloaded. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. This may include enabling the WSL 2 feature on your Windows and possibly restarting your machine.

- Verify Installation:
Once installed, you can open the Docker Desktop application to ensure it's running correctly. You can also open your command prompt and type ```docker --version``` to see if Docker responds with the version number, indicating itâ€™s correctly installed.

    ```shell
    docker --version
    ```


## Step 6: Prepare Your Flask Application

Your Flask application will serve as the interface for your PyTorch model predictions. Below are the steps to prepare it:

1. **Create Flask Application (`app.py`)**:
   - Set up your Flask app using the following template. Adjust the path to your PyTorch model file (`iris_model.pt`) as necessary.

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import torch

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # Load your trained TorchScript model
   model = torch.jit.load('iris_model.pt')

   @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
   def predict():
       data = request.get_json()
       inputs = torch.tensor(data['inputs'], dtype=torch.float32)
       with torch.no_grad():
           prediction = model(inputs)
       return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
    ```
2. **Create requirements.txt:**
- Create a file named requirements.txt in your project directory with the following contents to specify the necessary Python packages:
    
    ```shell
    Flask
    torch>=1.12.0
    ```
  2. **Test Your Flask Application Locally:**
  Before containerizing, you can test the Flask application locally. This will start a local web server. You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (useful if user needs a GUI) or ```curl``` (useful when running from CMD) to send a POST request to ```http://localhost:8080/predict``` with JSON data to test if it returns predictions correctly:

     - Run python app.py in your command prompt to start a local web server (this to be done from the same env, e.g., conda env, where the dependencies are installed):

         ```shell
         python app.py
         ```

     - Test the server using Postman or curl by sending a POST request to ```http://localhost:8080/predict``` with appropriate JSON data to ensure it returns predictions accurately. Example curl command (this is to be done from a separate terminal window, no need to be in the same directory or env as the Flask app):

         ```shell
         curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"inputs": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]}' http://localhost:8080/predict
         ```
       or this if testing from Windows CMD (Windows handles single quotes differently):
         ```shell
       curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"inputs\": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]}" http://localhost:8080/predict
        ```



Once Docker is set up and your Flask application is ready and tested locally, you can proceed with containerization, involving creating a Dockerfile and building a Docker image. 


## Step 7: Containerize Your Application

Before deploying to Google Cloud Run, containerize your application using Docker. This involves creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, and pushing that image to Google Container Registry (GCR).

### Create a Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project directory with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8080

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```


This ```Dockerfile``` sets up a Python environment, installs your dependencies, and sets the command to run your Flask application. **Make sure Docker is running** on your system before proceeding.

Build Your Docker Image
Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory where your ```Dockerfile``` is, and run:

```shell
docker build -t gcr.io/your-project-id/your-app-name .
```
Replace ```your-project-id``` with your Google Cloud project ID and ```your-app-name``` with a name for your app. Use ```gcoud projects list``` to find your project ID. Mind that our-app-name cannot have spaces, and is not directly related to the name of the Dockerfile or the Flask app. It's a name you choose for your container image.


Push the Docker Image to Google Container Registry
- First, ensure you're authenticated with Google Cloud:

    ```shell
    gcloud auth configure-docker
    ```

- Then, push your Docker image:

    ```shell
    docker push gcr.io/your-project-id/your-app-name
    ```
This prepares your application for deployment to Google Cloud Run by creating a container image that can be managed by Google's infrastructure.
